This is a python library/package for the Advanced image Analysis (AiA) course at DTU.

To use it put all the content into a folder called "AiA", and place this folder in your "site-packages" folder in your used python version.
Like this:
    "path/to/site-packages/AiA/contents-of-this-rep"

And then import it in python by:

import AiA

import AiA.snake

import AiA.plots.plot as plot
